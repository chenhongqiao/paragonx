This course is for students with experience in the AMCs (able to solve around 10 problems) that are aiming to qualify for and score some points on the AIME. Each class will cover one of the general topics that appear on the AMCs and the AIME, breaking down the types of problems that appear and providing examples ranging from easy to hard. Contest strategy will also be discussed.
