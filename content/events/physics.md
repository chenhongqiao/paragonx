## Description

This course is for students looking for a basic understanding of physics concepts and are preparing for AP Physics 1 or F=ma. Over the course of this program, we will be studying most of the topics within the field of mechanics that will allow a student to qualify for USAPHO. Aside from one hour lectures every week, this class will also have homework problems that we will review with students.
