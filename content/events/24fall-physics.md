## Description

This course will help students make the jump from the AP Physics 1 class to the necessary problem-solving skills required for competitions. The program will consist of weekly lectures adding to prior knowledge of the unit with assignments comprising problems from different textbooks and past F=ma exams. Prior knowledge of AP Physics 1 is recommended. The course is recommended for those interested in making the jump from school physics to competing in competitions. While students who have prior experience for physics competitions may gain from these classes, it may not be as efficient.
