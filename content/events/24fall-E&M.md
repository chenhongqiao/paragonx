## Description

The ParagonX E&M course is a course for students who have completed high school physics or AP Physics 1 with a strong, solid foundation in calculus. It covers most of topics in AP Physics C Electromagnetism. Over the course of eight classes, students will learn all the ideas covered in the AP curriculum and gain a solid understanding for the inner workings of electromagnetism. The class is weekly and has up to an hour of homework each week. Prerequisites: Calculus and Introductory Mechanics.
