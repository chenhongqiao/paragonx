## Description

This eight-class course is designed to teach students the key concepts frequently encountered in the USACO Bronze division and other major programming competitions. The concepts covered range from USACO Bronze to a brief introduction to USACO Silver. Each class will feature problems of varying difficulty levels, predominantly at the Bronze level, with occasional Silver-level problems. Classes will consist of both a lecture and a problem-solving session. Homework assignments and additional resources will be provided to support learning outside of class. By the end of the course, students who diligently complete the homework and engage with the material outside of class will have mastered the fundamentals of the Bronze Division.

Note: All material is different from the previous USACO Bronze courses.
