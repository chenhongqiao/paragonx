## Description

The electromagnetism course is a course for students who have completed high school physics or AP Physics 1 with a strong, solid foundation in algebra. It covers a wide array of topics in electromagnetism that are the foundation for AP Physics 2 and AP Physics C. Over the course of four classes, students will learn all the ideas covered in the AP curriculum and gain a basic understanding for the inner workings of electromagnetism. The class is weekly and has up to an hour of homework each week. Prerequisites: Algebra 2 and High School Physics.

## Syllabus

1. Electrostatics & Gauss’s Law
2. Magnetism and the Biot-Savart Law
3. Ampere’s Law and Lenz’s Law
4. Circuits
