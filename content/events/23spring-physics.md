## Description

This course will teach students how to apply physics to space and will help prepare them for the F=ma and give them a strong foundation to build upon for the US Astronomy and Astrophysics Olympiad. The lessons are designed to build on each other so that first the students can hone their understanding of mechanics, and then they can learn to apply Newtonian Physics to our solar system and other celestial objects. Classes will feature lectures and practice problems along with some reading homework to help students learn about the fascinating subject of Astrophysics. Physics background is recommended but not required.

NOTE: All material is different from the Semester 1 Physics Course.
