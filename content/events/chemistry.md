## Description

This course aims to teach students introductory chemistry and create a base on which students can prepare for chemistry contests like USNCO and grow a passion for the (explosive) subject. Each week will focus on a different aspect of chemistry, ranging from the Periodic Table of Elements to VSEPR Theory and biochemistry. Classes will consist of lectures, practice problems, and online games to develop the students' understanding of chemical principles.
