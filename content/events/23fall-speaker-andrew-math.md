Andrew Xie

We held two speaker events over Zoom this November. Our second speaker event featured Andrew Xie, a MOP invitee and has received rewards in various other prestigious math competitions. This event was held on Sunday November 5th, at 12pm-1pm PST. This event included Q&A sessions in which participants gained insight on how to succeed in such competitions.
