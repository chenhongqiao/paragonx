Austin Geng

We held two speaker events over Zoom this November: in our first event, Austin Geng, MOP invitee and IOI gold medalist, described his journey in competitive programming. This event was held on Saturday November 4th, at 12pm-1pm PST. This event included Q&A sessions in which participants gained insight on how to succeed in such competitions.
